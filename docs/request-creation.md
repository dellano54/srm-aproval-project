# Request Creation Feature

## Overview
The request creation feature allows users with the "Requester" role to create new approval requests within the SRM-RMP Institutional Approval System. This feature provides a form-based interface for submitting requests with all necessary details.

The request creation form includes the following fields:

1. **Title** (Required)

The validation rules are defined in the [CreateRequestSchema](file:///Users/user/Workspace/Projects/Research/SRM_Approval_System/SRM_APPROVAL/lib/types.ts#L52-L61) in [lib/types.ts](file:///Users/user/Workspace/Projects/Research/SRM_Approval_System/SRM_APPROVAL/lib/types.ts).

## API Endpoints
